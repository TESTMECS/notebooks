- ![Hierarchies in Spacetime](Hierarchies_in_Spacetime_.ipynb) - [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08795) -> fast algorithm that embeds hierarchical structures in three-dimensional Minkowski spacetime.
- ![Spacetime+Lorentz](Spacetime+Lorentz.ipynb) -> more testing on the embeds of hierarchical structures in spacetime, Lorentz trasformations which should persist length but change direction and therefore semantic meaning.
- ![Indivisible Stochastic Processes](Indivisible_Stochastic_Proccesses.ipynb) - [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-92238-8#Abs1) -> Testing non-Markovian methods for on the Chapman-Kolmogorov test which checks the degree to which a system follows a Markov process â€” meaning the future state depends only on the current state, not the past history.
