- ![Indivisible Stochastic Processes](Indivisible_Stochastic_Proccesses.ipynb) - [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-92238-8#Abs1) -> Testing non-Markovian methods for on the Chapman-Kolmogorov test which checks the degree to which a system follows a Markov process — meaning the future state depends only on the current state, not the past history.
  - ![Stochastic Quantum Simulation with Interaction Nets](Stochastic_Quantum_Simulation_with_Interaction_Nets_.ipynb) -> Simulate a locally causal, wavefunction-free model of quantum behavior (inspired by Jacob Brandes’s framework) using stochastic particle trajectories in configuration space.
