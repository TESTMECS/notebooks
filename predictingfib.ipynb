    "The `FibonacciEvent` class represents a single point (an event) in the 3D Minkowski spacetime.\n",
    "- Each event corresponds to a specific Fibonacci number, identified by its `index` (e.g., 0 for F_0, 1 for F_1, 2 for F_2, etc.) and its actual numerical `value`.\n",
    "- It has coordinates `t` (time), `x`, `y`, and `z` (spatial).\n",
    "- `t` is initially set to the Fibonacci index but will be adjusted during the causality enforcement simulation.\n",
    "- `x`, `y`, and `z` are initialized to random values between -1 and 1.\n",
    "- The `get_coords` method returns the event's coordinates.\n",
    "- The `__repr__` method provides a user-friendly string representation of the event.\n",
    "- The `__lt__` method is implemented to allow `FibonacciEvent` objects to be compared based on their index, which is necessary for the `heapq` (priority queue) used in A\\* search.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. MinkowskiSpace Class\n",
    "The `MinkowskiSpace` class manages a collection of `FibonacciEvent` objects.\n",
    "- The `__init__` method initializes an empty dictionary `events` to store the events, keyed by their Fibonacci index.\n",
    "- `add_event` and `get_event` are utility methods for managing events in the dictionary.\n",
    "- `calculate_spacetime_interval_sq` computes the squared spacetime interval between two events using the Minkowski metric (not standard Euclidean distance). A negative or zero squared interval means the events are causally connected (timelike or lightlike).\n",
    "- `is_causally_connected` checks if one event could causally influence another. This requires the potential parent to be earlier in time and the spacetime interval between them to be timelike or lightlike (within a small tolerance `epsilon_1`).\n",
    "- `enforce_causality_step` is a simplified simulation of the paper's algorithm to adjust event times to ensure that parent events are always in the past light cone of their children events in the *embedded* spacetime. If a causal violation is found, the child event's time is moved forward.\n",
    "- `find_parents_by_causality` simulates retrieving parent events by querying the past light cone of a child event within the embedded spacetime. It looks for events with smaller indices and checks if they are causally connected. It specifically checks for the expected Fibonacci parents (indices `N-1` and `N-2`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Embedding Simulation\n",
    "The `simulate_fibonacci_embedding` function orchestrates the process of embedding Fibonacci numbers.\n",
    "- It creates a `MinkowskiSpace`.\n",
    "- It generates a specified number of `FibonacciEvent` objects, one for each Fibonacci index, initializing their coordinates.\n",
    "- It then enters an iterative loop (`num_enforcement_iterations`) to enforce the causal relationships. In each iteration, it checks pairs of events (specifically potential parents like F_{i-1} and F_{i-2} for a child F_i) and adjusts the child's time coordinate if the causal condition is violated.\n",
    "- This iterative process aims to arrange the events in spacetime such that the inherent hierarchical structure of the Fibonacci sequence (where `F_N` depends on `F_{N-1}` and `F_{N-2}`) is reflected in their causal relationships in the embedding.\n",
    "- The loop breaks early if an iteration completes without any adjustments, suggesting the embedding has reached a stable causal configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Finding Next Fibonacci Randomly\n",
    "This function `find_next_fibonacci_randomly` demonstrates how, once events are embedded and causality is enforced, you might \"discover\" the next Fibonacci number.\n",
    "- It takes a `start_index` (the index of the current Fibonacci number, F_N).\n",
    "- It retrieves the corresponding event from the `MinkowskiSpace`.\n",
    "- It uses `find_parents_by_causality` to find the events in the past light cone that are considered its causal parents within the embedding.\n",
    "- It then attempts to identify the F_{N-1} event among these parents and uses the core Fibonacci relationship (`F_{N+1} = F_N + F_{N-1}`) to calculate the next Fibonacci number. This simulates inferring the mathematical structure from the causal structure of the embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. A* Search Implementation\n",
    "This function `a_star_search` implements the A\\* pathfinding algorithm within the embedded Minkowski space.\n",
    "- The \"nodes\" in this search are the Fibonacci indices.\n",
    "- The possible \"edges\" represent movements forward in the Fibonacci sequence, specifically from index `N` to `N+1` or `N+2`.\n",
    "- The goal is to find a path of indices from a `start_index` to a `goal_index`.\n",
    "- The cost to move between indices (`g_score`) is simply `1` for each step.\n",
    "- The heuristic function (`h_score`) estimates the remaining cost to reach the goal. Here, it uses the Euclidean spatial distance in the `(x, y, z)` coordinates between the current event and the goal event. While the paper focuses on causal structure (timelike/lightlike intervals), A\\* typically uses a distance heuristic. Using the spatial distance here is a simplification for demonstration.\n",
    "- `heapq` is used to manage the priority queue of nodes to explore, prioritizing nodes with a lower total estimated cost (`f_score = g_score + h_score`).\n",
    "- If a path is found, it returns a list of Fibonacci indices from start to goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overall\n",
    "In essence, this code provides a simulation of how the abstract mathematical relationships of the Fibonacci sequence might be represented and navigated within a geometric structure (Minkowski spacetime) by enforcing causal constraints derived from their dependencies (F_N depends on F_{N-1} and F_{N-2}). It's a conceptual demonstration of embedding mathematical structures into a spacetime geometry for potentially discovering or understanding their properties through spatial/causal exploration."
