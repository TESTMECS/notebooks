# Reorganizing Structure
Two folders
- TODO -> unfinished Notebooks that need more work. Includes `enc2dec.py` `newfile.py` `ps.ipynb` `twosum.py` `train_causal_model.py` and the other `.py` files. The `.ipynb` files are the finished ones
- Directories of topics. 
    - Contains `README.md` about topic background and details of notebooks.
    - Contains `outputs` for those particular notebook files if there are any.  

# Grouped Topics
1. Stocasticity - `Fractal_Interp_Functions.ipynb` `Indivisible_Stochastic_Proccesses.ipynb` `Stochastic_Quantum_Simulation_with_Interaction_Nets_.ipynb`
2. Neural Networks - `FibonacciNetwork.ipynb` `NumberNetworkBattle.ipynb` `spin_prime_wordnet.ipynb` `Vec2Vec.ipynb(not finished)`
3. Attention - `Causal_Attention.ipynb` `ConstructorTheory.ipynb`

Any other files can be just left in the parent dir. Do your best. You are confident.
